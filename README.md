# Machiavelli's Dialogo
Repository containing material for a stylometric analysis using R Studio and stylo package as described in chapter 6.2 of Sascha Resch's doctoral thesis at LMU Munich

# Textual corpus
Due to copyright the textual corpus used to run the stylometric analysis can't be published here. Instead, in chapter 6.2 of Sascha Resch's doctoral thesis at LMU Munich you can find a detailed list of the texts used and the preparational measures performed on the texts. Thus, the corpus can be rebuilt by anyone.

# Results
In this repository you find the results of the stylometric analysis as PNG and PDF files. This way, you have access to the complete data behind the research in chapter 6.2 of Sascha Resch's doctoral thesis (in chapter 6.2 only two diagrams could be published due to the limited space of the thesis)
